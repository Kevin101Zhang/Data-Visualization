# BigQuery Visual Data Analytics

## Project Description

```
Users build and run simplified SQL queries on public tech-flavored social media data from Google BigQuery API via the Node.js client library.

The requested data is then viewable in a number of graphical formats created using d3.js and recharts.js.

Additionally, statistical metadata generated using simple-statistics.js is also displayed alongside the graphs.

For help getting started, installation instructions, example usage or a list of technologies we used, please see below.
